# Sprite Documentation

This folder contains some example sprites that you can use for your projects. The `.png` files are the spritesheets you will use in your project. The `.md` files (also linked below) provide dimensions and information about each of the animations in the sprite. The `.aseprite` files are the source files used to create the sprites.

Read the `.md` files first by clicking the links for the sprite you want below. Each file provides metadata about the sprite, a breakdown of animations, and example usage code.
